<h2 title="
Good:
- Can solve non-linear problems.
- Can work on high-dimensional data with excellent accuracy.
- Easy to visualize and explain.
Bad:
- Overfitting. Might be resolved by random forest. A small change in the data can lead to a large change in the structure of the optimal decision tree.
- Calculations can get very complex.
