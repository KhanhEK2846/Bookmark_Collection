Good:
- Simple to implement and efficient to train.
- Overfitting can be reduced by regularization.
- Performs well when the dataset is linearly separable.
Bad:
- Assumes that the data is independent which is rare in real life.
- Prone to noise and overfitting.
- Sensitive to outliers.

Good:
- Less prone to over-fitting but it can overfit in high dimensional datasets.
- Efficient when the dataset has features that are linearly separable.
- Easy to implement and efficient to train.
Bad:
- Should not be used when the number of observations are lesser than the number of features.
- Assumption of linearity which is rare in practise.
- Can only be used to predict discrete functions.
