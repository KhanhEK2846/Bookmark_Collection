# SOLID

---

- Single responsibility – Closely related to separation of concerns
- Open/closed principle
- Liskov substitution principle – Change only implementation, not behavior. Otherwise change name!
- Interface Segregation – Keep interfaces as small as possible; provide specific interfaces for different counterparts
- Dependency inversion
